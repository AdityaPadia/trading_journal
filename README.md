# ðŸ““ Trading Journal

This repository documents my weekly journey in developing, testing, and refining trading strategies. I focus on strategies that generate alpha as well as focus on beta by finding mispriced companies.

Each week, I log my trades, rationale, execution details, and post-trade analysis to improve my decision-making and build a repeatable framework. The journal is designed to be **both a learning tool and a portfolio artifact** that demonstrates strategy thinking, risk management, and data-driven reflection.
