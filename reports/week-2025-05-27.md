# Week of May 27, 2025

## Overview
This week saw a mix of tactical plays around earnings and ongoing development of long-term thesis-driven positions. While the calendar spread strategy showed strong predictive power, execution inefficiencies led to a notable drawdown. On the longer horizon, positioning in undervalued assets like EUR, GLD, and pharmaceuticals continues. Work also progressed on infrastructure: building tools, testing strategies, and refining valuation frameworks.


## Important Events
### Market Events
* Earnings from NVDA, CRM, PATH, ZS, DELL, COST

### Political Events
* President Trump delays EU tariffs until July 9
* President Trump curbing shipmenets to China, focussed on chip design softare, chemicals and other shipments.
* President Trump accused China of not respecing trade agreement
* Elon Musk ends his time at the Government and DOGE

## Short Term Positions
### Long Calendar Calls
* Took Long Calendar Call Positions in various companies to profit off IV churn post earnings announcements
* These positions had high sharpe ratios of 1.5 and above and a high probability of profit
* Although some of these positions played out perfectly, I missed out on a lot of profit due to poor trade execution (slippage, early exits etc.)
* Net loss of around $25,000 from these positions this week


## Long Term Positions

### Currency
| Ticker    | Current Market Value |
| :--------: | -------: |
| EUR  | $56738    |
| USD  | $163144    |

I bought some EUR at $1.1336 USD as I expect the US and EU to reach a trade deal by July 9th and the EUR to increase in value post this trade-deal. However, strong US economic data and Fed decisions can affect this trade. 

### Index Funds
| Ticker    | Current Market Value |
| :--------: | -------: |
| VOO  | $108160    |

Passive exposure to S&P500, provides beta exposure. 

### Treasury Bills
| Ticker    | Current Market Value |
| :--------: | -------: |
| BIL  | $457118    |

Short term treasury bills are trading at high yields right now, therefore I have invested around half of my portfolio in low-risk high-yielding Treasuries.

### Pharmaceuticals
| Ticker    | Current Market Value |
| :--------: | -------: |
| NVO  | $21360    |
| LLY | $22113     |
| AZN    | $21885    |

I believe that NVO is massively undervalued at it's current price based. I looked at their financials and the dividend payoffs in the past to reach this conclusion. Although there are risks to NVO's GLP-1 drug due to declining sales, they are still the market leader. Furthmore, the diabetes rate is expected to grow massively in the next 5-10 years to around 30% of the US population and even more in some countries like India. Although most of NVO's revenues come from GLP-1 drugs, they are still the world's largest insulin supplier. From my historical portfolio simulation, I saw that investing in a equally balanced portfolio of the NVO, LLY, and AZN from 2015 to today has a higher sharpe ratio (0.89) as compared to the S&P 500 alone (0.65). Although, I am a bit skeptical of the valuation of LLY and I have not valued AZN yet, I am confident in this bet in the pharmaceutical industry. I am also planning to explore technology involved in tracking blood sugar and insulin levels. 


### Precious Metals
| Ticker    | Current Market Value |
| :--------: | -------: |
| GLD  | $98642    |

Similar to pharmaceuticals, I used the portfolio simulation code to track the performance of a portfolio equally invested in the S&P500 and GLD with monthly/yearly rebalancing as compared to the performance of a portfolio that is invested in the S&P500 alone. Historically, the former strategy has a much higher sharpe ratio of around (0.9) and a lower tail risk as compared to the latter which has a sharpe of (0.65). Therefore, I have invested in GLD ETF and S&P500 equally for the long term. I might change or reallocate the holdings in this strategy if I find better long term strategies with higher sharpe.


### AI + Datacenters
| Ticker    | Current Market Value |
| :--------: | -------: |
| VRT  | $21530    |

Dell expects their datacenter revenue to grow by 30% YoY until 2027. Vertiv (VRT) provides power and cooling solutions to datacenters and I believe that they will be a good growth stock in the future. I might even allocate some more money to NVDA to get a higher return from this strategy as they have much higher profit margins as compared to VRT.


## Opportunities
* Watch for undervalued sectors in Damodaran’s industry P/E tables
* Monitor macro impact on EUR/USD post tariff/trade decision
* High-IV earnings next week: candidates for improved IV churn strategy
* Tech in diabetes management + AI hardware = future research lanes
* Found a possible sell for GE Aerospace, I believe it is vastly overvalued based on P/FCF multiples
* Working on integrating QuantLib with real data to price options and bonds quantitatively
* Increase in OPEC+ Oil Supply, a possible trade on oil futures


## Risks
* EUR/USD might stagnate or reverse with strong US economic data
* GLD might underperform due to easing inflation data
* BIL might underperform due to bond market concerns, especially due to the 'Big Beautiful Bill'

## Other Stuff
* Used an open source API to build an internal Yahoo Finance web scraper tool. The code pipeline gets fundamental data and financial statements from Yahoo Finance and exports to Excel
* Built a backtesting engine that tracks a portfolio of stocks with different rebalancing options. The engine provides annual return, volatility, sharpe ratio and a histogram of returns for analysis
* Damodaran's list of industries published every January seem to be a good predictor of undervalued industries using trailing, current and forward PE ratios
* Researched in market microstructure, trade execution and competitive analysis in Finance
* Introduction to QuantLib and Backtesting.py libraries



## Reflection
* This week’s drawdown was a good reminder: idea quality ≠ execution quality
* Building real edge requires tools + discipline + feedback loops
* Journaling this is already helping identify recurring mistakes + blind spots
* Strategy calibration ongoing — signal is there; system refinement needed

## Next Week
There are many key economic data that is scheduled next week. 
This includes the PMI and ISM Manufacuring Data on Monday. Job openings and factory order data on Tuesday and services PMI on Wednesday. Trade deficit and productivity numbers on Thursday and the employment report on Friday.
